<b>Independent clauses</b>
A clause that can stand alone. It's a full sentence because it has a subject and a verb.

<u>Example</u>:
People danced.


<b>Dependent clauses</b>
A clause that cannot stand on its own.

<u>Example</u>:
While the fighting went on.


<b>Punctuation usages</b>
<u>Commas</u>: Indicates a pause between clause and/or separates items in a list
<u>(Em) Dashes</u>: Similar function with the comma, but usually better off at the end of a sentence.
<u>Parentheses</u>: Similar function with the comma, but words within them are non-essential to the sentence (contains no main subject/verb).
<u>Periods</u>: Used to separate independant clauses.
<u>Semicolons</u>: Functions the same as a period.
<u>Colons</u>: Best used before a list (like a comma), a quotation, or an explanation, but can also connect a dependent with an independent clause.
