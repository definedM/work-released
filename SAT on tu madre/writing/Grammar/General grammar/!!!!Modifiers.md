<b>Modifiers</b>
Modifiers are clauses that expand upon a phrase in the sentence. They can be used with or without commas, but when there is a comma to start the modifier, then another comma should appear where the modifier ends.
The ones defined below are the ones that frequently appear on the SAT.


<b>Relative Modifiers</b>
These further define a noun and begin with a relative pronoun of the following: <b>who</b>, <b>where</b>, <b>that</b>, <b>(in) which</b>, and <b>(by) whom</b>

<u>Examples</u>:
The fish <u>that were swimming in the ocean</u> leapt toward the lake.
Houses, <u>in which devalued over the decades</u>, suddenly had been demolished.


<b>Past participle modifiers</b>
A past participle modifier begins with a past participle (verbs with the past tense -ed or are in the past test).

<u>Examples</u>:
Moviegoers, <u>fatigued by the stairways</u>, struggled towards the theater room.
<u>Served with dessert</u>, the food looked delicious.
<u>Taken improperly</u>, the medication can be harmful.

<b>Gerunds</b>
These begin with a verb followed by the suffix "-ing". There are different things that a gerund could be, but the main ones are listed.

1. Subject
<u>Fishing</u> is an enjoyable hobby
In this sentence, <u>fishing</u> is the gerund subject as it is the name of a hobby and is the main subject here.

2. Modifier
<u>Flinging</u> food at others, he ran away to hide.
Since the gerund is describing/modifying what "he" did, it is a gerund modifier.

The gerund modifiers should be marked in any way you want (I write Ger. above it). However, if the gerund is just the subject, then simply mark it as the subject.
