<b>Prepositions (Part 1)</b>
Prepositions are used to connect nouns/pronouns to form a phrase that modifiers another word in the sentence, typically describing time or position. A prepositional phrase starts with a preposition and stops immediately after the object it modifies.

<b>Prepositions on the SAT(Part 2)</b>
Prepositions <u>never</u> contain the <u>main</u> subject and/or a <u>main</u> verb at all. Due to this, prepositions should almost always be crossed out on the SAT unless a part of the phrase is within the underlined choice for the question (crossing of these should not hide text so you can still read it for context for other questions). By doing so, the main subject(s) and main verb(s) is/are easier to correctly identify.

<u>Examples</u>:
He ran <s>through the rain</s>


<b>Uses of "to" in a sentence</b>
to+verb = infinitive verb
to+noun = preposition

Infinitive verbs are never the main verb in a sentence.
