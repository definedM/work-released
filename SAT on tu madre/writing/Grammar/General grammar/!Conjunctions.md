<b>Coordinating conjunctions</b>
Coordinating conjunctions include <b>for</b>, <b>and</b>, <b>nor</b>, <b>but</b>, <b>or</b>, <b>yet</b>, and <b>so</b>, which is seen in the acronym <b>FANBOYS</b>. With a comma before it, they connect independent clauses in a sentence.

<u>Examples</u>:
Hours went by quickly, <u>but</u> the sun hasn't come down yet.
He sees his friend on the other side, <u>so</u> he passes the ball over.


<b>Subordinating conjunctions</b>
A few examples of subordinating conjunctions are <b>even though</b>, <b>while</b>, <b>however</b>, <b>hence</b>, and <b>for example</b>.

When the subordinating conjunction is in the start of the sentence, the comma must go after the dependent clause that it creates. Otherwise if it's in the middle, a comma isn't neccessary.

<u>Examples</u>:
She may be wealthy <u>even though</u> she drives a Honda.
<u>While</u> they ran down the street, the flies chased after them.


<b>Marking conjunctoins</b>
Though marking conjunctions will not be neccesary, its important to know that there are conjunctions to fix the sentence accordingly with the conjunction.
