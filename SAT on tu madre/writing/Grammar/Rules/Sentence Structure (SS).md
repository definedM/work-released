<u>Rule of SS:</u>
1) Compare choices, then dissect sentence as done in general grammar practice
2) If you see 2 answer choices with similar format of which one has a period and one has a semicolon, omit both choices. For example, 
<s>A) had done. They then tried</s> 
<s>B) had done; they then tried</s>
3) Short Is Better - Wordy or repetitive choices are wrong, but they should <b>maintain the sentence's meaning/intentions</b>.

Example:
"Rather than simply admiring their idols from afar, the group's founders resolved to reach out to them, acknowledge their influence, and <b>(1)learning</b> from them."

"Rather than simply admiring their idols from afar, the group's founders(S) resolved(V) to reach out to them, acknowledge their influence, and <b>(1) learning</b> from them."

<b>Q (1)</b>
A) No change
<mark style = "background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255)";>B) learn</mark>
C) to learn
D) they learned

<mark style = "background-color:rgb(120, 255, 120)";>
The sentence structure is only maintained in (B), so</mark><mark style = "background-color:rgb(255, 120, 120)";>
the other choices are wrong.

<b>Q (2)</b>
A) No change

<mark style = "background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255)";>C) it would be like to pursure writing professionally.</mark>
D) it would be like to pursure writing professionally?

<mark style = "background-color:rgb(255, 120, 120)";>
The usage of question marks makes B and D gramatically incorrect as question marks only occur when the sentence contains words like "how would...", "why should...", etc. <br>
I forgot why answer choice A was wrong, but I unfortunately had to choose what I felt was "right"</mark><mark style = "background-color:rgb(120, 255, 120)";> which is C.
