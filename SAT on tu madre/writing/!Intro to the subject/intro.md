[[writing/!Intro to the subject/introFolder]]

Don't go by what you feel and <b>never assume</b>, go by the rules as much as you can (in the rules folder). If you can follow along wtih rules rather than feeling, you are definitely going to get a 400 on the writing section (unless you use what you feel on a lot of questions).

About 60% of the writing section will be all grammer/writing related stuff and the remaining ~40% will be reading comprehension (like the reading section of the SAT, but easier in general). It's a pretty easy section so try to get a full 400 on this section (the only mistakes in this section AND the math sections are ones where u forget or apply the wrong the rules/formulas, so there isn't rlly such a thing as a silly mistake, at least thats what the teacher said)
