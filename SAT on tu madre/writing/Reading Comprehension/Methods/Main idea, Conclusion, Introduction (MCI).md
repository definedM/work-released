<u>Method of MCI:</u>
1) Find the general idea (main idea isn't neccessary in most cases, the big picture is enough for time's sake).
2) I think the conclusion/introduction means to find the conclusion/introduction keyword (The following example has "introduces") .
3) Cross out wrong and irrelevant info (compared to the general/main idea).
<br>

Example:
"<b>(1)The DRC would eventually sponsor workshops and readings in several East Coast cities</b>. Strabge and Ellis held events on Sunday afternoons at their house, featuring art shows, discussions, readings, and performances. The events became so popular that attendees could not all fit into the living room and many had to listen from the front porch. Informally, the DRC also provided a space for its members to experiment in their creative pursuits and to inspire and critique each other."
